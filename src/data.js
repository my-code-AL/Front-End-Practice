I didn't hate it or anything, but as I grew older, I realized my opportunities were not at a maximum in Texas. That is why I moved away for college, and that is why I moved away after graduating college and moving back."

I think I appreciate the flexibility in topic matters afforded by front end and the large career opportunities that open once it is mastered. That's the real reason I am here. I've had professors tell me in the past that I was never cut out for coding or that I should just stick to what I was doing before. I think that also fuels my humble ambitions in part as well."
